## Overview

I used this challenge to practice my frontend skills and to build my first React application.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

## My process

When I started working on this project, I continued my practice with desktop first approach. Everything went smooth until I came to the part wherer I have to fix a lot of things for mobile devices. So I decided to keep all functionalities and to start with mobile-first approach.

Honestly, it was a lot of easier to make some elements better on mobile and to make them to look nice on desktop as well.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to work in React, file structure in React and SCSS. Also, I learned this time how to use mobile-first approach and how helpful it can be.

### Continued development

In the future I would like to practice and learn better:

- React
- CSS Grid
- Mobile first
- CSS animations

### Useful resources

- [SASS Guidlines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#introduction) - This helped me to learn SASS file structuring, mixins etc.
- [Dark Mode w/React](https://dev.to/cmcwebcode40/simple-react-dark-mode-with-scss-lae) - Since this was the first time for me to imlement dark mode and even to implement it in React I used this tutorial to make it possible.
- [Add/Remove Animations](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/creative-list-effects/) - I still didn't learn how to make css animations, so I used pre-made animations from this article for add/remove todos.

## Installation

### `npm install`

This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
